Here is some information about labcontrol concepts.

Overview
========
Labcontrol consists of a web server and command line tool for managing
a set of boards in a board farm.

The central abstraction of labcontrol is that a server manages boards
and resources (two different object types) in a lab. Currently, the
server executes actions in the lab using command line utilities on the
server side.  (In the future other backend interfaces may be
supported).

A client can access the server using either the command line tool,
called 'lc' or using a web-based REST API.  A client may either be a
human or an automated process (the test framework or a test).

The goal is to create a set of command line arguments and REST APIs
that are the same no matter what objects are being managed in the lab.
This will allow test frameworks and tests to be written in a manner
that is independent of the details of lab hardware, software and
configuration.

Finally, humans can also access a Web-based user interface to interact
with the object managed by the server.


Labcontrol Objects
------------------
A labcontrol object can be a board, represented by a board file on
the server, or a resource, represented by a resource file on the
server.

A 'board' is the primary object that has operations performed on it
and is usually at one of two endpoints that are involved in some
action.  A 'resource' is a piece of hardware or an application or
process in the lab that is used in conjunction with a board.  A lab
administrator describes the configuration of lab hardware
(connections, ports, wiring, etc.), by configuring labcontrol with
connections between the board and multiple resources.

For example, a board might be connected to a power controller, which
can turn a board on or off (provide power or not).  The power
controller would be a resource in the lab, and the specific power
controller would be registered with labcontrol, and the board would
have a "connection" to that resource.

Labcontrol takes commands that are issued to a board, and converts
them into an appropriate action on a resource connected to the board,
where that is applicable.

For example, when a user requests that the board turn on, labcontrol
would convert that request into a operation on the power controller
that was connected to the board.

Server-to-resource interface
----------------------------
The inteface between the server (lcserver.py) and local board
management tools is via command line.  A resource supports an action
by specifying a "{action}_cmd" attribute, which the server calls to
perform an action.  The output from the command is either interpreted
by the server or returned directly to the client.

This means that local commands need to have output that matches what
is required by the REST protocol, in the case where the data is
returned directly by the server.

In Tim Bird's Fuego lab, labcontrol resource files have attributes that
specify to call the 'ttc' command, which is a tool used in Sony's labs
to control boards and lab hardware.  This is shown in the sample
resource files that are included with the labcontrol distribution.

Future work
===========
In the future, it is planned to have the labcontrol server support a
python plugin API, to allow it to support lots of different resource
types.
