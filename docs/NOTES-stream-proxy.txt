Here are some notes about stream-proxy.py:

When the user requests streaming data, lcserver does this:
 - starts mjpg-streamer on the resource host
   - this creates a special-purpose web server that delivers
     data from http://<res_host>:8080/?action=stream
   - sets the configuration for a stream proxy instance
     - in lc-data/stream-proxies.dat
     - config contains id-> url mapping
     - each line has: <id>=<url>
   - the server provides the url: https://<lc_host>/stream-proxy/<id>

streamer-proxy is a CGI script that returns streaming data, forwarded
from the res_host mjpg-streamer instance.
  - on a request, it looks up the id in the config file
  - issues a request to the res_host
  - sends the data to the client
  - runs indefinitely

== NOTES:
 Apache doesn't give fine-grained control over http headers to a CGI script.
 A script can set the Content-Type and Cookies headers, but not
 other response header like:
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length
Date:
Keep-Alive:
Server:
Vary: Accent-Encoding
(HTTP protocol header: "HTTP/1.1 200 OK")
----

 - The HTTP/1.1 request header MUST include Host:
 - You can use Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding
   - a chunked message has:
     - a line with the size of the chunk data, in hex, possibly followed
       by a semicolon and extra parameters and ending in CRLF
     - the data itself, followed by CRLF
   - the last chunk has '0', followed by CRLF, followed by footers, then
     a final blank line

 - see https://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#whatis

 - must handle "100 Continue" responses from the server

 - all responses must have a Date: field

=== Research items Q/A ===
Does Apache do the gzipping, from the data that the CGI script provides?

Q. How does Content-Length work, when the size is not known ahead of time?
A. Content-Length can be omitted and a Transfer-Encoding header can be used.
If both headers are missing, then at the end of the response the connection
must be closed.
