Here are some notes about xterm support for the DUT

See ~/work/pyxtermjs/pyxtermjs

 - run with 'cd ~/work/pyxtermjs ; ./pyxtermjs'
 - access with: 'browser http://localhost:5000/'

This sample uses flask, and socket.io

I'll need async socket data transfer in order for this to work
for my needs.

It uses xterm.js javascript library from: unpkg.com
It uses ajav/libs/socket.io library from cloudflare.com

The actual flask app is in pyxtermjs/app.py (and it's very short)
