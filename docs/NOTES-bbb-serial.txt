Here is some information about beaglebone serial

= Hardware =

== uart pins on BBB ==
       pins:
        RX      TX      CTS     RTS     Device         Notes
UART0   J1_4    J1_5                    /dev/ttyO0     BBB only
UART1   P9_26   P9_24   P9_20   P9_19   /dev/ttyO1
UART2   P9_22   P9_21   P8_37   P8_38   /dev/ttyO2
UART3           P9_42   P8_36   P8_34   /dev/ttyO3     TX only
UART4   P9_11   P9_13   P8_35   P8_33   /dev/ttyO4
UART4   P8_38   P8_37   P8_31   P8_32   /dev/ttyO5


/boot/uEnv.txt has capemgr.enable lines, but in my current Beaglebone (bbb)
none of these are enabled.

== cable pins ==
Usb to serial cable pinouts:
black = GND    -> J1_1 (BBB GND)       -> P9_2 (BBB GND)
brown = CTS#
red = 5V
orange = TXD   -> J1_4 (BBB UART0 RX)  -> P9_26 (BBB UART1 RX)
yellow = RXD   -> J1_5 (BBB UART0 TX)  -> P9_24 (BBB UART1 TX)
green = RTS#

Beablebone connector J1

== Cable notes ==
The 'AQ' cable worked on J1 connector, but...

The cable worked for tx from board, but no chars were
echo'ed on when typed on the host side in minicom.

= how to find out pinmux setting on 4.4.88 kernel? =
 * examine boot messages - look for BB-UART messages during uboot overlays
 * use 'config-pin -q'  to see status of pins


BeagleBone is running 4.4.88-ti-125 kernel

New kernel is 4.4.155-ti-r155
