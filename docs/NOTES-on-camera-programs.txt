Here are some notes on camera stuff:

On the raspberry Pi board, there is a camera module, which can
be accessed using the program:
  raspistill

This can take a single image, and save it to a file.
I believe the raspberry pi camera module is NOT USB-based.

----
On Ubuntu, you can take a still picture using a graphical program
called "cheese".  I don't see a way to use cheese to take a picture
from the command line.
----

There is also 'webcam', but I don't know how it works.
I tried it, but it needs a config file, and it looks like
it always tries to transmit the data via ftp.  That is,
it looks highly specific for sending periodic image data
(like for a security camera) to another machine.

----
I downloaded streamer, and it seems to do what I want.

streamer -f jpeg -s 800x600 -c /dev/video2 -o $(date -Iminutes)-LogiTech-Streamer.jpeg
streamer pictures are quite dark
