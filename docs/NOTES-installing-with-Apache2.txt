To use labcontrol with Apache2, you have to do a bit of setup.

You need to:
 - install Apache and make sure it's running
 - install the lcserver.py script in a location where Apache can run it
 - configure the url_base and files_url_base in your /etc/lcserver.conf file
 - make sure that Apache passes authorization information
   (so users can log in via lc)

I got a lot of great info from:
 - Enabling Apache2 on Ubuntu 20.04:
   - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04
and
 - Enabling cgi scripts on Apache 2:
   - https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_20.04&p=httpd&f=5


Here's how I configured things:
 - cp /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lcserver.conf /etc/lcserver.conf
   - edit to customize for your lab
     - lab_name, admin_contact_str, and base_url

 - $ sudo ln -s /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lcserver.py /usr/lib/cgi-bin/lcserver.py
   - this creates the link for lcserver.py so apache can run it
 - $ sudo chown -h tbird.tbird /usr/lib/cgi-bin/lcserver.py
   - this sets the file ownership of the symlink.  With the default Apache2
     configuration, the ownership of the link must match the ownership of
     the file, in order for apache to execute it.  Use the appropriate
     user and group for your situation (whatever user and group you
     used when you installed labcontrol)

 - $ a2enmod cgid
   - this enables /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf

 - $ sudo ln -s /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lc-data /var/www/html/lc-data
   - this makes the direct-files link for serving raw json files

 - $ sudo chgrp -R www-data /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lc-data
 - $ sudo chmod -R g+rw /home/tbird/work/labcontrol/lc-data
   - make all labcontrol data files are accessible by the web server.  By
     default the web server runs as user www-data and group www-data, which
     is what the CGI script (lcserver.py) will run as, as well.
     Set the group on the data files so the script can access and modify
     the files.

 - $ sudo vi /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf
   - add the following line in the section <Directory "/usr/bin/cgi-bin">
      CGIPassAuth On

 - $ sudo systemctl reload apache2
   - reload the configuration
